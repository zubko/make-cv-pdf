        Developed small scale Windows Mobile games and apps, 3 middle scale
        games for PC. 1 game was also for Mac. (Development cycle of 1 game was
        around 8-10 months). For the 3rd game I developed a script language
        which was a DSL suited best to code a level of point'n'click type of a
        casual game.
